# MyReads Project

`MyReads` project is a virtual library project as part of the requirements of the Udacity's React nanodegree. The frontend is written in React and the backend is provided by Udacity [here](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com).

The library has 3 virtual shelves:
* Currently reading
* Want to read
* Read

and a search function to add new books to the shelves. The available queries can be found [here](SEARCH_TERMS.md).

_Note_: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies using npm:

````bash
npm install
````

## Usage

To run the app in development mode:
````bash

By default it will use port 3000, so you'll be able to find the app in [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
